# Dog-Vision (Attempt)
**Follow along project #2** from Complete A.I. & Machine Learning, Data Science Bootcamp

End-to-end Multi-class Dog Breed Classification This notebook builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow 2.x and TensorFlow Hub

**Notebook only includes code. To view image output, data must be reimported to Google Drive and code re-run**

* End-to-end Multi-class Dog Breed Classification
This notebook uses TensorFlow 2.x and TensorFlow Hub to create an end-to-end multi-class image classifier  

### Jupyter Commands:
https://towardsdatascience.com/jypyter-notebook-shortcuts-bf0101a98330/

### Create a new notebook here:
https://colab.research.google.com/
* Can connect colab.research.google.com homepage to runtime to run the notebook

### Tensorflow with GPU:
https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/gpu.ipynb

### Data Source:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data

### Data Reimport:
Reimport Data to "drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Dog Vision" in Google Drive

**Note:** This colab notebook is running on Google GPU (See RAM and Disk info).
* If the runtime disconnects, all of the data that we have stored on google's machines could be lost (e.g. data overflow).
* If data is uploaded to colab and the runtime disconnects, you would lose everything that you were working on (not good).
* If the runtime disconnects, "Reconnect" then re-run some variables so that we are able to regain access (e.g. tensorflow, tensorflow_hub)
* Sessions can disconnect randomly. At that time you would need to re-run all cells after reconnecting
* See limitation notes here: https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html
